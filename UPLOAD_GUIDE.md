## Security Notes

### Token Storage
- Your token is stored in **browser localStorage**
- It's only visible on your device
- Clear it by: Opening browser console and running `localStorage.removeItem('githubToken')`

### Token Permissions
- The token only has access to repositories you specify
- You can revoke the token anytime at [GitHub Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### Best Practices
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't share your token** with anyone
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't commit the token** to any repository
- ‚úÖ Use a **dedicated token** for uploads (not your main GitHub token)
- ‚úÖ Set an **expiration date** on the token
- ‚úÖ **Revoke old tokens** when no longer needed

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid token" error
- Verify the token has the correct permissions (`repo` or `public_repo`)
- Check if the token hasn't expired
- Try generating a new token

### "Upload failed" error
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the file size is under 25MB
- Make sure the file type is supported
- Check GitHub service status

### File already exists
- You'll be prompted to overwrite
- Click OK to replace, or Cancel to skip

### Files not appearing after upload
- Click the **"Refresh"** button in the filters section
- Check your GitHub repository to verify the files were uploaded
- Clear your browser cache

## Tips

### Bulk Upload
- Select multiple files at once (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click)
- Drag multiple files from your file explorer
- Maximum recommended: 10 files at once

### File Naming
- Use descriptive names: `class1_2025_midterm.pdf`
- Avoid special characters: `@ # $ % & * ( )`
- Spaces are OK but underscores are better

### Organization
- Upload files to the correct class immediately
- Use consistent year formatting
- Keep file names clear and searchable
