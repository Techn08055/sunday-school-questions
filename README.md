## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository (e.g., `sunday-school-questions`)
2. You can make it public or private
3. Clone the repository to your local machine

### 2. Organize Your Files

Create a folder structure in your repository like this:

```
sunday-school-questions/
├── Class_1/
│   ├── 2024/
│   │   ├── question1.pdf
│   │   ├── question2.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── 2023/
│       └── ...
├── Class_2/
│   ├── 2024/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── 2023/
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

**Folder naming conventions:**
- Class folders: `Class_1`, `Class_2`, `Class1`, `Grade_1`, etc.
- Year folders: `2024`, `2023`, etc. (4-digit years)
- Files: Any PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, or WEBP files

### 3. Configure the Website

1. Open `config.js` in the website files
2. Update the following values:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    githubUsername: 'your-github-username',
    repositoryName: 'sunday-school-questions',
    branch: 'main',  // or 'master'
    questionsPath: '',  // if files are in a subfolder, specify here
    githubToken: '',  // optional, see below
};
```

### 4. GitHub Personal Access Token (Optional but Recommended)

GitHub has rate limits for unauthenticated API requests (60 requests per hour). To increase this limit:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Sunday School Website")
4. Select scopes:
   - For public repos: `public_repo`
   - For private repos: `repo`
5. Generate and copy the token
6. Add it to `config.js`:

```javascript
githubToken: 'ghp_your_token_here',
```

⚠️ **Security Note**: If you're hosting this publicly, consider using environment variables or a backend proxy to hide your token.

### 5. Deploy the Website

You have several options:

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. Create a new repository for the website (e.g., `sunday-school-website`)
2. Push all the website files to this repository
3. Go to repository Settings > Pages
4. Select the branch (usually `main`) and root folder
5. Save and wait a few minutes
6. Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/sunday-school-website/`

#### Option B: Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Drag and drop your website folder
3. Your site will be deployed instantly

#### Option C: Vercel

2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Deploy with one click

- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Static Web Apps
- Cloudflare Pages

## Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" error
